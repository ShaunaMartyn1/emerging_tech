    "## Introduction\n",
    "Classical computing is built on classical bits which can be represented as either 0 or 1. Classical computers process information using Boolean logic. The data is encoded in a binary format in a sequence of 0s and 1s. Operations are performed in a sequence and the outcome depends on the state of the bits. Classical algorithms are step-by-step instructions designed to solve specific problems. Classical computers use RAM (Random Access Memory) to store data temporarily. There are limitations of solving complex problems using classical computing such as factoring large number or simulating quantum systems. Scaling classical computers becomes challenging for certain types of problems due to physical constraints such as power consumption, memory access times, transistor size and heat dissipation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing operates on quantum bits(qubits) which can exist in superposition states (a combination of 0 and 1). Quantum computers use quantum gates for processing information such as Hadamard gate and CNOT gate. These gates can perform operations on qubits in superposition. Quantum information is represented using a combination of states, allowing for parallel processing of multiple possibilities. Quantum computers utilize the unique properties of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement to process and manipulate information in a way that allows them to perform multiple computations at the same time. Quantum algorithms like Shor’s Algorithm or Grover’s Algorithm use quantum principles to solve specific problems more efficiently than classical algorithms. Quantum memory is more complex and is an area of active research. It involves maintaining superposition states without collapsing into definite values. Quantum computing has the potential for solving problems like factoring large numbers, simulating quantum systems, and optimising complex systems. The development of quantum computers is still in its early stages. Building and maintaining stable error resistant qubits is significantly challenging. The term “quantum supremacy” refers to the point at which a quantum computer can solve a problem that would be practically impossible for classical computers to solve in a reasonable time frame. The field of quantum computing is developing quickly. \n",

Deutsch’s algorithm uses principles of quantum computing to achieve this with just one query to the function. This demonstrates how quickly quantum algorithms can provide over classical computing algorithms for certain types of problems. \n",

For example, if `f(x)` -1, it means that when given x the function outputs a 1. \n",

This means they can be in a combination of both 0 and 1 simultaneously. The superposition property allows qubits to represent and process a much larger amount of information simultaneously compared to classical bits. \n",
    "Superposition is a basic principle of quantum mechanics. It allows a quantum systems like qubit, to exist in multiple states at the same time. When a measurement is made, the superposition collapses, and the qubit takes on a definite state (either 0 or 1). The probability of each outcome is determined by the superposition coefficients. \n",

Regardless of the distance between them. Entanglement is crucial for various quantum algorithms and applications, including quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography. \n",

It plays a crucial role in creating superposition states, which are a key feature of quantum algorithms like Grover’s algorithm and quantum teleportation. If you start with a qubit in a definite state either 0 or 1, applying the Hadamard gate puts it in a superposition of both states. The probability of each state is equal, which means the qubit is likely to be measured in either state. For example, when a coin is flipped the superposition of heads and tails until it is measured. The Hadamard gate is like this. It puts the qubit in a state of superposition and its only when you measure it that it “chooses” a definite state. \n",

    "## Limitations of Deutsch’s Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deutsch’s algorithm is tailored for a narrow class of problems, specifically aimed at discerning whether a given function is either constant or balanced. It doesn’t have broader applications. \n",
    "The algorithm assumes access to an oracle function that provides the information in one step. In real-world scenarios, obtaining such an oracle may not always be feasible. \n",
    "The problem Deutsch’s algorithm addresses (constant vs. balanced functions) doesn’t have immediate practical applications. This makes the algorithm more of a theoretical demonstration that a practical tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenarios where Deutsch’s Algorithm might not be suitable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\t**Complex Functions:** It is designed for 2-bit functions. It does not generalise well to functions with larger inputs. \n",
    "2.\t**Oracles with Limited:** Query Access: In many real-world situations, querying an oracle can be costly, and it might be necessary to minimize the number of queries. Deutsch’s algorithm, which only requires one query, might not be useful in such cases. \n",
    "3.\t**Non-Boolean Functions:** Deutsch’s algorithm assumes that the function being analysed is a Boolean function. If the problem involves non-Boolean functions, this algorithm will not be applicable. \n",
    "4.\t**Problems with More Complex Output Spaces:** Deutsch’s algorithm works with simple Boolean outputs (0 or 1). For problems with more complex output spaces (e.g., real numbers, strings, etc.) this algorithm will not be suitable. \n",
    "5.\t**Applications Requiring Multiple Oracle Queries:** In many real-world problems, multiple queries to an oracle might be necessary to gather sufficient information. Deutsch’s algorithm, which relies on a single query, would not be the most efficient choice in the scenarios. \n",
    "6.\t**Problems Requiring Classical Verification:** Some problems may require classical verification after the quantum phase. Deutsch’s algorithm does not directly facilitate this and would require additional classical steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Deutsch’s algorithm is a fascinating theoretical demonstration of quantum advantages, it has limited practical utility for most real-world problems. It serves more as a foundational concept in quantum computing theory rather than a widely applicable algorithm. \n"
