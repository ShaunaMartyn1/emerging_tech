    "Begin with any positive integer x. This will be the starting point for generating the sequence.\n",
    "2. **Apply the Collatz Function f(x):**\n",
    "The Collatz function f(x) is defined as follows:\n",
    "If x is even, f(x) is x ÷ 2.\n",
    "If x is odd, f(x) is 3x + 1.\n",

    "The result of this function becomes your new x.\n",

    "4. **Observe the Pattern:**\n",
    "As you continue to apply f(x), observe the numbers that are generated.\n",
    "The Collatz conjecture states that no matter what positive integer you start with, you will eventually reach the cycle 1, 4, 2.\n",
    "Once you reach 1, the next number will be 4 (since 3 * 1 + 1 = 4), and then 2 (since 4 ÷ 2 = 2), and then back to 1 (since 2 ÷ 2 = 1).\n",
    "5. **The Unsolved Part:**\n",
    "The conjecture has been tested for very large numbers and always seems to fall into this cycle.\n",
    "However, a formal proof that this will always be the case for every positive integer has not yet been found, making it one of the great unsolved problems in mathematics."

    "It starts with an initial guess z0 for the square root, which is set to x / 2. This is a common heuristic for starting the approximation.\n",
    "2. **Setting the Threshold:**\n",
    "A threshold value is defined, which determines how close the approximation needs to be before the function stops iterating. In this case, the threshold is set to 0.01.\n",
